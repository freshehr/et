			purpose = <"To record the Creatinine clearance.">
			use = <"To record the Creatinine clearance rate (CCr or CrCl), the volume of blood plasma that is cleared of creatinine per unit time and is a useful measure for approximating the Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (describes the flow rate of filtered fluid through the kidney).
 
In order to standardize the entry of the creatinine clearance used for the kidney after other organ transplant bonus, the centers should enter the serum creatinine into the system. The system calculates the creatinine clearance using:
- The Schwartz equation formula for recipients ≤18 years of age;
- The MDRD for recipients >18 years of age.



LOINC:
The above mentioned measurement methods are not (yet) available in LOINC. Maybe we should consider to use the GFR (which is what Schwartz and MDRD seem to be intended for): http://loinc.org/reference/technical-briefs/gault-formula-for-estimating-creatinine-clearance.pdf

NB: This is not cloned in templates from laboratory-tests but specialized. The reason for this is that maintainability becomes hard when there are changes in the model, but the correspondending constraint can occur in more templates (which will happen because, ET decided to have archetypes which can occur in several templates.
