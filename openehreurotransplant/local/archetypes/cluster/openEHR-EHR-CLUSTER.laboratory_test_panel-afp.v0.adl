Alpha-1-fetoprotein (AFP) is a key variable in prenatal screening for the detection of trisomy 18, 21 and neural tube defect. It is also the primary tumor marker for nonseminomatous testicular cancers. Post-operative AFP levels that remain above normal imply residual tumor, and/or tumor recurrence. AFP can be high in up to 70% of patients with primary hepatocellular carcinoma. Elevated AFP levels have occasionally been found in association with gastrointestinal tract cancers. 
Serum AFP is also elevated in ataxia telangiectasia, hereditary tyrosinemia, teratocarcinoma, and non-cancerous hepatic conditions, such as acute viral hepatitis, chronic active hepatitis and cirrhosis. Elevation of serum AFP in non-cancerous hepatic diseases is usually transient.

NB: This is not cloned in templates from laboratory-tests but specialized. The reason for this is that maintainability becomes hard when there are changes in the model, but the correspondending constraint can occur in more templates (which will happen because, ET decided to have archetypes which can occur in several templates.">
