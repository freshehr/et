Part: C peptide
In the beta cells of the pancreas, the proinsulin molecule is cleaved to form insulin and C-peptide. C-peptide, a polypeptide consisting of 31 amino acids (MW~3000), is stored in the secretory granules of the beta cells and released into circulation in equimolar amounts with insulin. Aids in diagnosis and treatment of patients with abnormal insulin secretion including diabetes mellitus.">
