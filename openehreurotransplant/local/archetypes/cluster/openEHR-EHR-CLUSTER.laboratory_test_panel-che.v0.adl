Pseudocholinesterase is also known as plasma cholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, or (most formally) acyl choline acylhydrolase, found primarily in the liver. An absence or mutation of the pseudocholinesterase enzyme leads to a medical condition known as pseudocholinesterase deficiency, which is a silent condition which only manifests itself when people who have the deficiency receive the muscle relaxants succinylcholine or mivacurium during surgery.

Cholinesterase measurement (procedure) 

NB: This is not cloned in templates from laboratory-tests but specialized. The reason for this is that maintainability becomes hard when there are changes in the model, but the correspondending constraint can occur in more templates (which will happen because, ET decided to have archetypes which can occur in several templates.
