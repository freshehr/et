This archetype is used in the context of Eurotransplant. 

Parenchyma -> parenchyma: clinical information about kidney-parenchyma

Nephrolithiasis/ Renal Calculi -> Nephrolithiasis/ Renal Calculi : clinical information about renal calculi.

Hydronefrosis/ Obstruction -> Hydronefrosis/ Obstruction : clinical information about hydronefosis

Measurements -> Measurements : measurements of kidney and parenchyma

Space Occupying Lesion is a cluster, it has two items, one is the location of the space occupying lesion and the other holds information about space occupying lesions, it is an archetypeslot.
The cluster has occurences unbounded, there can be more of them, and every lesion inside the cluster consists of a location kidney related) and the archetypeslot. Both have occurrences of 0..1 (optional)">
			use = <"Regarding Parenchyma, Hydronefrosis/ Obstruction, Nephrolithiasis/ Renal Calculi:
They contain inside these clusters a Status-item and a CodedText with the same name as the cluster.
The status item (also coded text) contains only one item: \"Not investigated\", it is optional, as also is the other coded text. Because the archetype model, currently, does not support dependent conditions, it must be used in this way:
- It is important to understand the following: 
Like a business-rule following must be noted: A coded text must be used if the status-item is not used. On the other hand, if the status-item (\"Not investigated\") is used, the other coded text in the same cluster will be ignored by the software.">
