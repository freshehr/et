Antithrombin 	- 	Pt 	PPP 

Antithrombin and antithrombin III refer to the same thing but today, however, antithrombin is the correct name. Antithrombin is a small glycoprotien, produced in the liver that inactivates several enzymes of the coagulation system including thrombin as well as factors Xa, IXa, XIa, XIIa, and kallikrein. Heparan sulfate (heparin), located on endothelial cells, binds to antithrombin causing a conformational change that results in its activation. Antithrombin deficiency is present in 0.17% of the general population. It accounts for 1.1% of unselected patients with venous thrombosis and up to 5% of patients younger than 70 years with thrombosis. Over 127 mutations in the antithrombin gene are known to cause hereditary antithrombin deficiency. Individuals heterozygous for antithrombin deficiency have a fivefold increased risk for venous thrombosis. Homozygous deficiencies are usually fatal.

NB: This is not cloned in templates from laboratory-tests but specialized. The reason for this is that maintainability becomes hard when there are changes in the model, but the correspondending constraint can occur in more templates (which will happen because, ET decided to have archetypes which can occur in several templates.
