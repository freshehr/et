Regarding Space Occupying Lesion-cluster:
It contains inside this cluster a Status-item and a CodedText with the same name as the cluster.
The status item (also coded text) contains only one item: \"Not investigated\", it is optional, as also is the other coded text. Because the archetype model, currently, does not support dependent conditions, it must be used in this way:
- It is important to understand the following: 
Like a business-rule following must be noted: A coded text must be used if the status-item is not used. On the other hand, if the status-item (\"Not investigated\") is used, the other coded text in the same cluster will be ignored by the software.

There is also \"Lesion Type\", a list of values, which lists most commonly used lesion-types, and it contains a free text, which can be used for any remark in this context.

When one or both are used, the Space Occupying Lesion-cluster must not have used the status-item (\"Not investigated\") and it must have the list of values in the other item of this cluster set to \"Yes\"
